Before you travel, get tested with a viral test 1-3 days before your trip.
Wear a mask over your nose and mouth when in public.
Avoid crowds and stay at least 6 feet/2 meters (about 2 arm lengths) from anyone who did not travel with you.
Get tested 3-5 days after your trip and stay home and self-quarantine for a full 7 days after travel, even if your test is negative. If you donâ€™t get tested, stay home and self-quarantine for 10 days after travel.
